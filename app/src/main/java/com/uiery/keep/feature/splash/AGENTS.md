# splash feature

## Purpose
Splash/startup route that initializes local state and directs users into onboarding or the main app.

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SplashNavigation.kt` | Type-safe navigation route and graph wiring for Splash. |
| `SplashScreen.kt` | Compose screen for the Splash flow. |
| `SplashViewModel.kt` | Orbit MVI view-model/state holder for Splash. |

## Subdirectories
No documented child directories.

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Follow the existing Orbit MVI pattern: immutable `UiState`, one-time `SideEffect`, and intent methods that reduce state or post effects.
- Keep Composable screens stateless where practical; route user events into the feature ViewModel.
- Place feature-private UI pieces in `component/` instead of expanding screen files indefinitely.

### Testing Requirements
- ./gradlew :app:testDevDebugUnitTest
- ./gradlew :app:assembleProdDebug
- ./gradlew :app:connectedDevDebugAndroidTest when Android services/receivers/permissions/resources require device validation.

### Common Patterns
- Feature package pattern: `{Feature}Navigation.kt`, `{Feature}Screen.kt`, `{Feature}ViewModel.kt`, optional `component/` package.
- Compose + Orbit MVI are the default interaction model.
- Navigation routes are type-safe Kotlin objects/classes rather than raw string constants.

## Dependencies
